# quantrel — Coming Soon

This repository contains a minimal black-and-white retro "coming soon" landing page for Quantrel.

Built with simple, dependency-free HTML and CSS intended to be lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Preview
Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the page.

## Local development
- Open the file directly in your browser: double-click `index.html` or run `start index.html` from a Windows `cmd.exe` prompt.
- Or run a simple static server (requires Python):

  python -m http.server 8000

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

If you use VS Code, the Live Server extension also works well.

## Files
- `index.html` — the landing page markup
- `styles.css` — black & white retro styles

## Customization
- Edit the logo text, tagline, or styles in `styles.css` to match your branding.
- If you want an email sign-up form wired to a provider (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Netlify Forms, etc.), open an issue or request and it will be added.
